          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>First Deliverable:</strong> Use your Project One directory in Github to create a 
              Project Two directory. You can branch it or create a new empty repostory and just copy and past
              your project 1 code. If you want to learn branching, seek help videos online. Create a new Basecamp post 
              under "Project Two" with a link to your new directory. Your post should include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The URL to your Project 2 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages 
                  live link
                </li>
                <li>
                  Six screen capture images of successful validation. One HTML and one CSS validation for
                  each website page (Use the live link to validate).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Two questions eliciting feedback from fellow students
                </li>
              </ul>  
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Second Deliverable:</strong> Give constructive comments to help at least three other
              students. Post a picture of those three comments on your Basecamp folder. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Final Deliverable:</strong> You will receive a list on your Basecamp post of required 
              fixes from the professor or TA. Fix your code and edit your original Basecamp post with the 
              words "FINAL TURN IN".

              One valid, error-free CSS file with your original code; and one file containing the CSS reset 
              code you used. Both linked from the head of all three HTML files
            </li>
            <li>
              Apply at least five of the same style elements to each of your pages. Example removing the 
              list-style from navigation on all three pages with a single CSS deceleration. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Apply at least five different style elements to each of your pages.

            </li>
            <li>
              Your HTML and CSS files should both be indented with 2 spaces per level of indent;
              indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further indent all rules and
              blocks inside your media queries
            </li>
            <li>
              You must use relative units (em, rem, vm, %) in your CSS to make your pages fluid. You may use 
              px units to put a maximum size or within content areas. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Create at least one fluid layout page using relative units (em, rem, vm, %) and one fixed width
              layout page.
            </li>
            <li>
              A subjective grade will be applied to websites that are not creative and just apply the 
              minimum required style.
