      <h3>Cayman Islands</h3>
      <p>May 2024 | Rating 9/10</p>
      <p>I really enjoyed this trip! The people were so welcoming and nice. I got my scuba diving lisence on this trip, which was probably the most memorable part of my experience. The food is also very expensive but it is such a cool island with a lot to do.</p>

      <h3>Thailand</h3>
      <p>December 2022 | Rating 10/10</p>
      <p>My mother is from Thailand, so my rating is biased but Thailand is definitely my favorite place in the world. The food is so authentic and pricing is very cheap. I really reccommend visiting!</p>

      <h3>Belgium</h3>
      <p>March 2020 | Rating 6/10</p>
      <p>I was in Belgium right at the peak of COVID so there weren't a lot of things open/vailable to do. It was also chilly and rainy. I think if I were to go back at a different time of year I would enjoy it more. Still such a beautiful country, the people are so nice and I loved the architecture.</p>
